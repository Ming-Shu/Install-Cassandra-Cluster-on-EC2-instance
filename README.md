Configuring Cassandra
In order to connect to our Cassandra server we will need to configure it. We will be changing configuration in the main Cassandra configuration file located at /etc/cassandra/cassandra.yaml. Open this file so and make the following changes.

    cluster_name: 'Your Cluster Name'
    
    seeds:"EC2 public_IP"

    listen_address: <EC2 private_IP>
    
    rpc_address: <0.0.0.0>
    
    broadcast_address:<EC2 public_IP>

    broadcast_rpc_address:<EC2 public_IP>
